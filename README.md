# Facial-Landmarks-Detection
Implementation of A Facial Landmarks Detection System, i.e. eyes, lip, etc, using Opencv in Pyhton.

**OpenCV** is the cross-platform open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It is mainly used for image or video processing and also analysis including object detection, face detection, etc.
Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent important regions of the face, such as:
* Mouth
* Eyes
* Eyebrows
* Nose
* Jawline 
* *etc.*

The project aims to detect the first two facial landmarks using accurate Image Processing algorithm in Opencv v3.
